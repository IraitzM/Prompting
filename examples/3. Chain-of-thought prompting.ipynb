    "# Introduction to Chain of Thought Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning is a technique that guides language models to solve complex problems by breaking them down into intermediate steps. Instead of providing a direct answer, the model is prompted to \"think aloud,\" generating a sequence of logical steps that lead to the final solution. This approach improves accuracy and interpretability, especially for tasks that require multi-step reasoning.\n",
